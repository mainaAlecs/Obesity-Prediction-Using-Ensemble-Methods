Obesity Prediction Using Ensemble Methods
This project presents a machine learning pipeline for predicting obesity levels using a range of lifestyle, physical, and dietary indicators. Developed as part of a Kaggle competition, the final solution uses ensemble learning—specifically a Random Forest classifier—to achieve robust and accurate predictions across seven obesity categories
